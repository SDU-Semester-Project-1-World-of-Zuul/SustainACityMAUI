**SustainACityMAUI** is an immersive simulation game that empowers players to build and manage a city with an eye on sustainability. This cross-platform version, built with .NET MAUI, allows for a seamless experience across iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows.

## 📚 Introduction

The game invites players to take on the role of a city planner, making critical decisions to balance environmental, social, and economic challenges. Inspired by the UN's Sustainable Cities and Communities goal, SustainACity encourages strategic thinking and environmental awareness.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Get the Code**: Clone the repository to start shaping your city.
2. **Build and Run**: Set up your development environment with .NET MAUI and run the project.
3. **Play and Explore**: Use text commands to build districts, manage resources, and interact with NPCs to achieve sustainable development.

## 🛠️ Project Structure

The codebase is thoughtfully organized to reflect various aspects of the game, including district management, NPC interactions, and player progression. While the exact structure may evolve, the core components are designed to be modular and scalable.

## 📌 Contributing

We welcome contributions from fellow city planners (developers)! To contribute:
- **Clone and Set Up**: Fork the project and create your feature branch from `dev`.
- **Make Your Changes**: Develop your feature with sustainability in mind.
- **Submit a Pull Request**: Merge back into `dev` and we'll take it from there.
